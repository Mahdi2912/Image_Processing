# Mathematics Behind Image Processing  

This repository explores the mathematical foundations and practical applications of image processing, as demonstrated through a Python-based notebook. The notebook showcases key concepts, processes, and visual results in image transformations, enhancements, segmentation, and more.  

## Overview  
The notebook serves as a guide to understanding how mathematics shapes the field of image processing. It covers:  
- **Image Transformations**: Flipping, rotating, and scaling.  
- **Image Enhancement**: Contrast adjustment, histograms, and thresholding techniques.  
- **Feature Extraction**: Edge and corner detection, filtering.  
- **Segmentation and Morphology**: Superpixels, erosion, dilation.  
- **Applications**: Face detection, privacy protection, and image restoration.  

## Key Features  
- Detailed explanations of processes with visual examples.  
- Integration of mathematical principles, including linear algebra, signal processing, and probability.  
- Hands-on demonstrations with images processed directly in Python.  

## Requirements  
To run the notebook, ensure the following Python libraries are installed:  
- `numpy`  
- `matplotlib`  
- `scikit-image`
